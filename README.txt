# Project 1: Traffic Animation

## Overview

This program shows a car (wheel, whatever)
going across a road, with a body of water
above and grass below, upon which a pedestrian
is standing.

## Compiling and Using

Compile.

## Discussion

This program was the first really difficult program,
involving many relative objects. Because this is a
graphic animation, the objects needed to stay the same
size regardless of the window size, so everything was
measured based on the height and width of the screen.

## Testing

This program involved a lot of testing, both intentional
and unintentional. I had to boot up the program to check
if my code was working, and I also found several mistakes
during testing that I didn't even realize would show up.
The sizes of the objects and their positioning was by far
the most tedious process, involving several hundred tests.

## Extra Credit

The object wraps around such that when it appears on the
other side, it fades in rather than simply appearing.
